# Student_Management_System
This C++ code appears to be a simple Student Management System. It allows users to manage student records for two divisions, Division A and Division B.

Here's a brief description of the code structure and functionality:

1. It includes several standard C++ libraries like iostream, fstream, string, and others for input/output and file handling.

2. The `student` class is defined to encapsulate the functionality of the student management system. It includes methods for inserting, displaying, modifying, searching, and deleting student records for both Division A and Division B.

3. The main menu [`menu`] allows users to choose between Division A, Division B, or exit the program.

4. Division A [`menu_a`] and Division B [`menu_b`] menus offer options for adding, displaying, modifying, searching, and deleting student records, as well as returning to the main menu or exiting the program.

5. The code uses file handling to store student records in text files (`studentRecord.txt` for Division A and `divisionb.txt` for Division B).

6. Functions like `insert`, `display`, `modify`, `search`, and `deleted` are implemented to perform corresponding operations on student records.

7. For Division B, similar functions are implemented with names suffixed by `_b`, such as `insert_b`, `display_b`, `modify_b`, `search_b`, and `deleted_b`.

8. The program continually prompts the user to return to the main menu or exit after each operation.

9. The main function initializes an instance of the `student` class and starts the program by calling the `menu` method.
